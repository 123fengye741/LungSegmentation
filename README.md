This code is modified for our needs for CS676 at BYU.

# About this repository

This repository is not intended to be an out of the box solution for the DSB challenge. It will not run out-of-the-box
without editing. That was not its intention.

The intent behind this tutorial was to presented a series of steps that can be followed as a starting point for competitors. 
Our hope is that this can save competitors time in framing the problem and that they can lift some of this code to speed 
up their own solution generation. We expect that the competitors efforst will supercede this tutorial in short order--which
is, of course, the point of the competition. 

Thanks for participating and helping to advance cancer diagnosis!

Everything in this repo uses a different remote than the DSB3Tutorial. So rather than "push origin master", "push cs676 master" is used.
